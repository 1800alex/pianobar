#1
Sometimes songs are not played completely (skipped in the middle); curl returns
CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE (file larger/smller than expected): This *is* a server-side
issue and cannot resolved by requesting the remaining parts of the audio file,
because the server does not support partial file requests. The only way to
resolve this is to download the songs, instead of assuming, that pandora
streams its music. They shouldn't be surprised about their traffic bills...
