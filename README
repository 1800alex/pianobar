pianobar/libpiano
=================

libpiano is a shared library to access the xmlrpc api at pandora.com.

pianobar will be a pandora.com music player.

This software is not yet complete and only implements essential functions to
connect to pandora, authenticate, getting a station- and playlist and play the
first song from the first station. Currently you need to be a developer to get
this piece of code working... But the code is well-documented, I think.

XML-RPC API
===========

You might want to have a look at the api documentation. Currently only
available in german, but this may change:

Are you pandora.com? Read this!
===============================

"Why are you doing this?" you might ask. This is my anwer: I love your service
(recommendations are much better than those from last.fm, audio quality is much
better, stationS that actually *learn* what I like, ...), but your flashplayer
sucks! (25% CPU load and a browser window is too much for playing music) So I
decided to write a free-to-use (even you could use it commercially!) library
and player to access your service.

By the way: It's useless to change the encryption/decryption key. It won't take
a week to get it working again, because the key is visible to every decompiler
and debugger.
